<b>ELON MUSK REVERENCE: AN INFANTILE DISORDER</b>
<br>
<br>
Capitalism is not merely an economic system. It is a culture, which shapes the way we think and act to its own advantage. It wants to make us buy more stuff. But beyond that it moulds the way we evaluate both ourselves and other people, encouraging us to view material wealth as a measure of virtue. The prevalence of personality cults formed around businesspeople in recent times is a dire testament to this. Among STEM types, nobody seems to exemplify the phenomenon better than Elon Musk. A Scientist. An excellent businessman. A genius. A cool guy. Or so they say. Well.<br><br>

So. Tony Stark is a great comic-book character (bear with me). He's rich, he's attractive, he's intelligent, he’s revered. And he's got an infinite amount of money for building Big Boy Toys. He's supposed to be a Great Scientist, in some way. But of course his hyper-exaggerated mad-inventor slash superhero persona is completely antithetical to the moral philosophy that underpins real-life scientific enquiry.  Then again Tony Stark is a fictional character, and he was created to appeal to young boys.<br><br>
Egotism, self-aggrandisement, and the procurement of personal wealth and/or glory have rarely, if ever, driven real-life human scientific advancements; collaboration, collective effort, and passion, on the other hand, definitely have. We should remember this when trying to make sense of Mister Elon Musk, whose public persona could be seen as a twisted imitation of our billionaire big-boy Tony Stark.<br><br>
Like let's consider Musk's academic profile: noteworthy, but hardly exceptional. He’s got a bachelor's degree in Physics and Economics. And he started a PhD in Applied Physics at Stanford, but then dropped out after just two days.<A HREF="#1"><sup>1</sup></A> <A NAME="a"> <br>  
He’s obviously a clever dude. But he's probably not the Titan of Science he's often made out to be. I think the innovation often accredited to him and his 'companies' has little to do with the man himself, and a lot to do with the army of qualified scientists working for him. And then the money he uses to pay them comes from the profits her reaped off the back of the Silicon Valley boom in 90's. And that was a boom facilitated by the handover of state-sponsored scientific research and technology  (read: almost everything that makes the internet possible) to private companies (like his) for their own use and profit.<br><br>
So the question I ask is this: is Musk a great genius? Or was he just in the right place at the right time? We can't hold luck or chance against a person, per se. But we should be critically aware of the ways such 'Great Men' might be benefitting from (or even completely reliant on) the research and development afforded by others. I myself would say Lord Musk in particular is merely masquerading as an innovator and risk-taker. The $70 million he has invested from his Boom money (no doubt supplemented by money from his family’s emerald mine<A HREF="#2"><sup>2</sup></A><A NAME="b">) seems pretty meagre compared to the $3.5 billion he's received in government subsidies and grants — and that's just for his car company. Billionaires, of course, like to hate on what they think of as 'socialism.' So they'd never admit how much they benefit from their own caricature of it by obliging ordinary people, that is, American taxpayers, to underwrite their risky business ventures. And then the taxpayer isn't even a shareholder in these ventures — they merely foot the bill for their expansion. Martin Luther King Jr. had it right when he said:<br>
<br>"This country has socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the poor."<br><br>
So maybe he's not really a scientist. But you don't need to be a scientist to warrant admiration from lots of people. Another question then: is he a good person? Well. Recently some factory workers at Tesla organized in order to bargain for the raising of their wages (some of the lowest in the US automobile industry) and for the improvement of their working conditions, which they said were unsafe.<A HREF="#3"><sup>3</sup></A> <A NAME="c">    Musk responded by sending an email to all of his employees, first accusing the organizing workers of being automobile industry plants, and second promising (as a substitute for a decent wage?) that he'd install ‘free frozen yoghurt stands’ and a rollercoaster enabling ‘fast and fun travel … dipping in and out of the [Tesla] factory’. Yup.<A HREF="#4"><sup>4</sup></A> <A NAME="d">   His admirers might think frozen yoghurt is an adequate substitution for dignity and agency in the workplace. But I bet that if they themselves were on the receiving end of Musk’s frozen-yoghurt-and-rollercoaster-infused bullwhip, they’d change their minds. Or maybe not – some of them want so much to be him that anything he does is justifiable, even if completely ridiculous.<br><br>
Like the thing last summer with the Tham Luang cave rescue. A youth football team got stranded in a subterranean cave network in Thailand. Musk, apparently an expert on the subject of cave diving, offered to build a 'kid-sized submarine' to rescue them. When Vernon Unsworth — a world-renowned cave diver from Britain — called out Musk's self-serving publicity stunt for what it was, Musk accused him of being a paedophile. When threatened with legal action, Musk apologised — but then went on to claim that Unsworth was a 'child rapist' who had married a twelve year old in Thailand. Claims that are completely unsubstantiated.<A HREF="#5"><sup>5</sup></A> <A NAME="e">    Right.<br><br>
The idealisation of Mister Musk is an expression of a cultural trend that arose in the wake of the Silicon Valley Boom, centred on relatively affluent young people studying and working in STEM fields. Though it has a trendy, youth-ey veneer, it's little different to what preceded it. For it is a culture that promotes the practice of a perverse type of freedom: the freedom to tread on people and control their behaviour. <br><br>
Musk can force his employees into submission through intimidation tactics and threats to their livelihoods.<A HREF="#6"><sup>6</sup></A> <A NAME="f">    Slander someone as a child rapist. Commit securities fraud. Spend stupid money on useless projects like the Boring Company and Hyperloop. Then wrap it up by smoking a joint on the Joe Rogan Podcast and retiring to one of his five multi-million dollar mansions. Nice! Couldn’t really get any closer to the ultimate male fantasy of success in our consumption-driven capitalist world, could you.<br><br>
Aside from being generally repugnant, this persona is fundamentally anti-science, like I said earlier. Science is not built on individuals and egos. When paying respect even to the greatest scientific minds of history, we should remember, crucially, that all of them were the beneficiaries of the successes (and failures) of countless others who came before them. And that's not to speak of the way the immediate conditions of their lives — their parents, their education, their wealth — might have dictated whether or not they could become scientists in the first place. Stephen Jay Gould got it:<br><br>
"I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein's brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops." <br><br>
It's about time us STEM minded folks shook off this misplaced reverence. It's about time we acknowledge that the greatest human advances arise through collective endeavours. The egomaniacal aspirations of characters like Elon Musk won't do us any good.  Indeed, it is just such characters — that is, the exceedingly selfish corporate and political leaders of recent history — that have led us to the point we’re at now. The precipice of Climate. Fucking. Catastrophe. But then, you know, maybe a few rich people having Teslas will help. No, yeah, I'm sure it will.

<b>PEOPLE SUFFERING. PEOPLE DYING</b><br><br> 
We thought we’d use some space this issue to share some of the poetry of Xu Lizhi, a former factory worker at Foxconn in Shenzhen, China. Foxconn is a contract company that manufactures consumer electronics on behalf of other companies – it manufactured (among others) the Blackberry, the iPhone, the Amazon Kindle, the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 4. The company is known for its poor working conditions, and for the high rate of suicide among its employees, which led to the installation of suicide-prevention nets around its premises in 2010.<br><br>

Lizhi’s poetry reflects the inner struggle of a person compelled to work in terrible conditions.<br><br>
 
He took his own life in 2014, at the age of 24.<br><br><br><br>


"I Fall Asleep, Just Standing Like That"<br><br>

The paper before my eyes fades yellow<br>
With a steel pen I chisel on it uneven black<br>
Full of working words<br>
Workshop, assembly line, machine, work card, overtime, wages...<br>
They've trained me to become docile<br>
Don't know how to shout or rebel<br>
How to complain or denounce<br>
Only how to silently suffer exhaustion<br>
When I first set foot in this place<br>
I hoped only for that grey pay slip on the tenth of each month<br>
To grant me some belated solace<br>
For this I had to grind away my corners, grind away my words<br>
Refuse to skip work, refuse sick leave, refuse leave for private reasons<br>
Refuse to be late, refuse to leave early<br>
By the assembly line I stood straight like iron, hands like flight,<br>
How many days, how many nights<br>
Did I - just like that – standing, fall asleep?<br><br>

-- 20 August 2011<br><br><br><br>





"Rented Room"<br><br>

A space of ten square meters<br>
Cramped and damp, no sunlight all year<br>
Here I eat, sleep, shit, and think<br>
Cough, get headaches, grow old, get sick but still fail to die<br>
Under the dull yellow light again I stare blankly, chuckling like an idiot<br>
I pace back and forth, singing softly, reading, writing poems<br>
Every time I open the window or the wicker gate<br>
I seem like a dead man<br>
Slowly pushing open the lid of a coffin.<br><br>
-- 2 December 2013<br><br><br><br>
