<b>ELON MUSK REVERENCE: AN INFANTILE DISORDER</b>
<br>
<br>
Capitalism is not merely an economic system. It is a culture, which shapes the way we think and act to its own advantage. It wants to make us buy more stuff. But beyond that it moulds the way we evaluate both ourselves and other people, encouraging us to view material wealth as a measure of virtue. The prevalence of personality cults formed around businesspeople in recent times is a dire testament to this. Among STEM types, nobody seems to exemplify the phenomenon better than Elon Musk. A Scientist. An excellent businessman. A genius. A cool guy. Or so they say. Well.<br><br>

So. Tony Stark is a great comic-book character (bear with me). He's rich, he's attractive, he's intelligent, he’s revered. And he's got an infinite amount of money for building Big Boy Toys. He's supposed to be a Great Scientist, in some way. But of course his hyper-exaggerated mad-inventor slash superhero persona is completely antithetical to the moral philosophy that underpins real-life scientific enquiry.  Then again Tony Stark is a fictional character, and he was created to appeal to young boys.<br><br>
Egotism, self-aggrandisement, and the procurement of personal wealth and/or glory have rarely, if ever, driven real-life human scientific advancements; collaboration, collective effort, and passion, on the other hand, definitely have. We should remember this when trying to make sense of Mister Elon Musk, whose public persona could be seen as a twisted imitation of our billionaire big-boy Tony Stark.<br><br>
Like let's consider Musk's academic profile: noteworthy, but hardly exceptional. He’s got a bachelor's degree in Physics and Economics. And he started a PhD in Applied Physics at Stanford, but then dropped out after just two days.<br>  
He’s obviously a clever dude. But he's probably not the Titan of Science he's often made out to be. I think the innovation often accredited to him and his 'companies' has little to do with the man himself, and a lot to do with the army of qualified scientists working for him. And then the money he uses to pay them comes from the profits her reaped off the back of the Silicon Valley boom in 90's. And that was a boom facilitated by the handover of state-sponsored scientific research and technology  (read: almost everything that makes the internet possible) to private companies (like his) for their own use and profit.<br><br>
So the question I ask is this: is Musk a great genius? Or was he just in the right place at the right time? We can't hold luck or chance against a person, per se. But we should be critically aware of the ways such 'Great Men' might be benefitting from (or even completely reliant on) the research and development afforded by others. I myself would say Lord Musk in particular is merely masquerading as an innovator and risk-taker. The $70 million he has invested from his Boom money (no doubt supplemented by money from his family’s emerald mine ) seems pretty meagre compared to the $3.5 billion he's received in government subsidies and grants — and that's just for his car company. Billionaires, of course, like to hate on what they think of as 'socialism.' So they'd never admit how much they benefit from their own caricature of it by obliging ordinary people, that is, American taxpayers, to underwrite their risky business ventures. And then the taxpayer isn't even a shareholder in these ventures — they merely foot the bill for their expansion. Martin Luther King Jr. had it right when he said:<br>
<br>"This country has socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the poor."<br><br>
So maybe he's not really a scientist. But you don't need to be a scientist to warrant admiration from lots of people. Another question then: is he a good person? Well. Recently some factory workers at Tesla organized in order to bargain for the raising of their wages (some of the lowest in the US automobile industry) and for the improvement of their working conditions, which they said were unsafe.  Musk responded by sending an email to all of his employees, first accusing the organizing workers of being automobile industry plants, and second promising (as a substitute for a decent wage?) that he'd install ‘free frozen yoghurt stands’ and a rollercoaster enabling ‘fast and fun travel … dipping in and out of the [Tesla] factory’. Yup.  His admirers might think frozen yoghurt is an adequate substitution for dignity and agency in the workplace. But I bet that if they themselves were on the receiving end of Musk’s frozen-yoghurt-and-rollercoaster-infused bullwhip, they’d change their minds. Or maybe not – some of them want so much to be him that anything he does is justifiable, even if completely ridiculous.<br><br>
Like the thing last summer with the Tham Luang cave rescue. A youth football team got stranded in a subterranean cave network in Thailand. Musk, apparently an expert on the subject of cave diving, offered to build a 'kid-sized submarine' to rescue them. When Vernon Unsworth — a world-renowned cave diver from Britain — called out Musk's self-serving publicity stunt for what it was, Musk accused him of being a paedophile. When threatened with legal action, Musk apologised — but then went on to claim that Unsworth was a 'child rapist' who had married a twelve year old in Thailand. Claims that are completely unsubstantiated.  Right.<br><br>
The idealisation of Mister Musk is an expression of a cultural trend that arose in the wake of the Silicon Valley Boom, centred on relatively affluent young people studying and working in STEM fields. Though it has a trendy, youth-ey veneer, it's little different to what preceded it. For it is a culture that promotes the practice of a perverse type of freedom: the freedom to tread on people and control their behaviour. <br><br>
Musk can force his employees into submission through intimidation tactics and threats to their livelihoods.  Slander someone as a child rapist. Commit securities fraud. Spend stupid money on useless projects like the Boring Company and Hyperloop. Then wrap it up by smoking a joint on the Joe Rogan Podcast and retiring to one of his five multi-million dollar mansions. Nice! Couldn’t really get any closer to the ultimate male fantasy of success in our consumption-driven capitalist world, could you.<br><br>
Aside from being generally repugnant, this persona is fundamentally anti-science, like I said earlier. Science is not built on individuals and egos. When paying respect even to the greatest scientific minds of history, we should remember, crucially, that all of them were the beneficiaries of the successes (and failures) of countless others who came before them. And that's not to speak of the way the immediate conditions of their lives — their parents, their education, their wealth — might have dictated whether or not they could become scientists in the first place. Stephen Jay Gould got it:<br><br>
"I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein's brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops." <br><br>
It's about time us STEM minded folks shook off this misplaced reverence. It's about time we acknowledge that the greatest human advances arise through collective endeavours. The egomaniacal aspirations of characters like Elon Musk won't do us any good.  Indeed, it is just such characters — that is, the exceedingly selfish corporate and political leaders of recent history — that have led us to the point we’re at now. The precipice of Climate. Fucking. Catastrophe. But then, you know, maybe a few rich people having Teslas will help. No, yeah, I'm sure it will.

This article (amongst other damning info) contains a quotation from a representative of Uber:
<br>
<br>       
“The app is simply showing there are partners time. This is not a representation of the exact number of drivers or their location. This is more of a visual effect letting people know that partners are searching for fares. I know this seems a [sic] misleading to you but it is meant as more of a visual effect more than an accurate location of drivers in the area. It would be better of you to think of this as a screen saver on a computer. Once a rider request [s] a trip there will be actual information about the partners [sic] location showing up in the app.”

“In the mid-1980s, East German consumers continued to complain of both a shortage of workers in the service sector and deficient quality. Automobile repair facilities were inadequate, for example, as were supplies of spare parts … the number of supermarkets and other stores, restaurants, and service centers had risen significantly by the mid-1980s — it seemed clear that meeting the needs of an increasingly prosperous society would remain a problem in East Germany for the foreseeable future. In the 1980s, the government acknowledged the existence of the problem and encouraged specialized private craftsmen and traders to help fill the void.”

<b>AUTO-FUCKING MATION</b>
<br><br>
So the constant growth the West once relied upon to continually expand job opportunities is failing. On average, new businesses create 40% fewer jobs than they did 20 years ago. Even during recent periods of economic growth, levels of employment have not risen in real terms.<A HREF="#8"><sup>8</sup></A> <A NAME="h"><br> 
The reality is that the economy is reliant on an ever-shrinking workforce. And according to 37% of British adults, many of the jobs that remain feel meaningless and performative.<A HREF="#9"><sup>9</sup></A> <A NAME="i">  The problem is that as a society we maintain a sense of self-worth based on and inextricable from our jobs, even if they are unnecessary and underpaid. And so we see automation not as an opportunity, but as an existential threat. The idea seems to be that if we lost our jobs, we would lose something integral to our humanity.<br> 
Obviously there are jobs we can agree should be done by humans, like nursing, and social care. But why shouldn’t we automate the menial work done in offices, warehouses, and factories? It may be difficult to conceive of, but the time freed from work could be used to nurture creative and social capacities that are for now often unavailable to those working these kinds of jobs.<A HREF="#10"><sup>10,</sup></A> <A NAME="j"><A HREF="#11"><sup>11</sup></A> <A NAME="k">  And beyond that, more free time for any activity would be good, right?<br>
Automation reduces required labour time and makes production more efficient. How about using the time saved to reduce the working week? How about spreading the remaining work across the population? Neither of these ideas is even new. Our working weeks have been reduced before. We owe the two-day weekend we’ve got now to the widespread absenteeism of workers on “Saint Mondays” in the 19th century.<A HREF="#12"><sup>12</sup></A> <A NAME="l">  
The logistics of nationwide work-sharing are surmountable. Similar schemes were successfully implemented in Germany to maintain employment levels after the 2009 crash. And work reduction would benefit society.  When the competition for a petty wage is removed, the door is opened for tighter knit communities to form. More free time means less stress, and fewer burdens on the elderly and those struggling with mental health issues.<A HREF="#13"><sup>13</sup></A> <A NAME="m">  Reducing work could help save the environment too. Like it’s estimated that a switch to a shorter European working week in the US would result in a 20% drop in energy consumption nationwide.<A HREF="#14"><sup>14</sup></A> <A NAME="n">  Because work-related energy consumption doesn’t just come from production itself – travel, and the wasteful convenience goods demanded by busy lifestyles play a massive part too.<br>
Automation could reduce all of this while maintaining production output. And since it could in this way play a key part in abetting environmental catastrophe, it should be an urgent political demand. But until now automation has been surrendered to the ‘market’. And this has resulted and will likely continue to result in higher energy consumption, obviously to the detriment of the environment.<A HREF="#15"><sup>15</sup></A> <A NAME="o">   And then not even 10% of the US companies that could implement automation have, despite its increasing accessibility.<A HREF="#16"><sup>16</sup></A> <A NAME="p">   Confusing, right. Somehow wages are so stagnant that human labour is often still cheaper than automation.<A HREF="#17"><sup>17</sup></A> <A NAME="q">  
This is where UBI comes in. In order for the prosperity that automation can create to be distributed equitably, we must argue for a liveable universal basic income. Not as a replacement for state services and welfare policies – that would be insensitive to the variety of needs within society – but as a supplement to them. Beyond the potential alleviation of poverty for all citizens, a liveable UBI would bend market forces to the advantage of regular people: really unpleasant jobs would have to be better paid, and that in itself would incentivize their automation.  It’d make “if you don’t like it – leave” a legitimate option for everyone, and would weaken the capacity for economic coercion that underlies abusive relationships both in and out of the workplace.<br> 
Funding for UBI remains a political obstacle rather than an economic one. In the UK the richest 10% of households hold 45% of the wealth, where the bottom 50% hold just 8.7%. A progressive tax used to fund UBI would not meaningfully impact the ability of the rich to live, to eat well, to clothe themselves, to be free from economic anxiety. But these apparent luxuries are denied to the 22% of the UK population who live in poverty,<A HREF="#18"><sup>18</sup></A> <A NAME="r">  and who would benefit massively from the implementation of a UBI. Reallocating existing resources in this way would avoid the problem of inflation so often brought up in conversations about UBI.<br>
Many people across the ‘political spectrum’ seem to agree that increased automation and the implementation of UBI are inevitable. But there’s still lots of disagreement as to what forms they will take. The proposals outlined here may seem ambitious. But there’s a lot at stake, and without a collective effort to prioritise ecology and societal cohesion, the power of automation will be wasted in pollution and profit. So.<br><br>
Demand automation.<br><br>
Demand a liveable, universal, basic income.<br><br>
Demand free time.
