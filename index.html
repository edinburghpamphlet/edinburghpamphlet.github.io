In recent years the way we think about the future has been completely hijacked by dystopian fantasies. They’re everywhere: on TV and in films, in books and the news media. They are often presented as Intelligent Critiques of The System. But their content betrays a bleak impotence when it comes to conceptualising of a future that does not involve either catastrophe or systematized absurdity. What we lack and what we need are well-articulated alternatives for the future. Visions that are at once reasonable, optimistic, and accessible to all. Let’s have a go.
<br>
<br>
THING ABOUT MAKING THINGS AND GETTING THINGS TO EVERYBODY WHO NEEDS THE THINGS
<br>
<br>
So, Technology. It’s everywhere you bloody look. Over here. Over there. Yesterday, when I opened my front door. Technology was standing right there, naked, reading a biology textbook. I mean, fucking hell, something out of a film.<br>
Seriously though. Sometimes seems technology is progressing at an absurd rate. Like watch the Google keynote for [current year] – insane. And sorry for being obvious, but it is mad that lots what of what we do each day in [also current year] is facilitated by complex computer programs.<br>
When we use them they’re impressively simple. Example: on your phone, they recommend you a book/film/garment/etc. you’ll probably like. So you buy it. And if you’re lucky (or have Amazon Prime) it’ll be in your hands within 24 hours. Wham. Bam. 
The way computer-aided processes like this actually work can seem pretty abstract and inexplicable, sort of dislocated from the Real World where people eat Haribo Starmix and do shits in the toilet. But I guess we can nail it down to a couplthings. 1st, instantaneous wireless communication. 2nd, programs designed to improve their own efficiency and productivity based on the data they gather.<br>
So they recommend you the thing based on data about what you (and people like you) have ordered/looked at in the past. You buy it, and Amazon wirelessly requests money from your bank. The bank accepts, money gets transferred from your account to Amazon, and some of that money gets transferred to the item’s seller. A request is sent to a regional distributor; your local warehouse may already have the item stocked based on their prediction you’d buy it.<sup>1</sup>  The driver takes your package along a precisely optimized delivery route that distributes stops over a set time period, accounting for traffic and other factors.<sup>2</sup>   Thank you ma’am.<br>
This sort of technology is how Uber can get me from where I am to where I wanna be within 15m. How Google/Siri/Amazon Echo can give you what you’re searching for. And also how I can have sexual relations with a person on a remote Pacific Island in real-time using a remote-control knob/punanni/other and a cheap webcam – not saying I do.<br>
All impressive. Not all good. Take Uber. Who like I said also use data they’ve gathered to ‘refine their service’. They know a rider is more likely to order an expensive Uber if their phone battery is low – so they hike the prices if it is. And that they’re more likely to order if they can see cars nearby on the map – so they show fake ones if there aren’t real ones around.<sup>3</sup>   I’m not making this up. But that’s it – this technology is amazing and useful, but is only really being used to make profit for shareholders.<br>
Meanwhile things are shit, let’s agree. People dying. People suffering. Shitty jobs. Shitty pay. High rent. Polluted air/water/food that’s only getting worse. And more. How many basic requirements for a decent life aren’t being met properly because doing so wouldn’t be profitable? <br>
Obviously this question’s been asked before. In the past century many countries experimented with economic alternatives meant (they said) to fix these problems.  Thing is they failed, more or less. Why? I’m not sure exactly. But one reason lots of people give is inefficiency. Though quality of life was generally really good,<sup>4</sup>   ‘Central Planning’ in places like ‘socialist’ East Germany did lead to absurdity, especially when it came to ‘consumer’ goods – toilet paper, tampons, tissues, tents, Twix. It was hard for planners to keep track of the vast networks of local supply and local demand for such things. Like what kind of chocolate people in the north-western bit of the south-eastern bit of the seventh-largest city in the country preferred, and whether they had the incorrect opinion, i.e. that Twix isn’t by far the best. A shop might have loadsa beer, but no tissues. Or, god-forbid, the other way round. It was so bad the government ended up encouraging small private enterprises – a big no-no given the whole ‘socialist’ thing – in order to help solve the problem.<sup>5</sup> <br>   
Thing is they were basically doing it all on paper. They didn’t have computers or any of the shit Uber’s got to efficiently track and respond to countless variables in real-time. And now I think you might see what I’m getting at – what if they did.<br>
Well, when President Salvador Allende of Chile started nationalizing foreign-owned industry in 1970 in order to fund public projects, he encountered similar problems.<sup>6</sup>   But interestingly he actually tried using new tech to fix them. A system called Cybersyn linked all the firms in the country (Chile, in 1970!) and allowed them to send info both to each other and to the government. A program monitored national input/output statistics based on the communications. It could intelligently recognize anomalies, and, if appropriate, send alerts so people could quickly respond to them. Firms could detect problems in their operation and fix them. Sectors of industry could efficiently coordinate to fix larger problems, and also just to be more productive.<sup>7</sup>   Data gathered over a long period was used to predict future data. Sounds pretty similar to a lot of the systems companies use today, right? Unfortunately a coup overthrew Allende in 1973 and Cybersyn was dismantled. It hadn’t worked perfectly. Didn’t gather enough variables, for one. And this was the 1970s. The network was based on electromechanical typewriters that could only relay data once a day, for fuck’s sake.<br>
What I’m thinking is what if we tried again. What if we used the immense coordinating power technology has provided us to facilitate a more just society? Ambulances that know where they need to be before an accident happens – shit like that. Basic things like clean water distributed for free to everyone who needs them, precisely and efficiently –  shit like that. Just a thought.

This article (amongst other damning info) contains a quotation from a representative of Uber:
<br>
<br>        
“The app is simply showing there are partners time. This is not a representation of the exact number of drivers or their location. This is more of a visual effect letting people know that partners are searching for fares. I know this seems a [sic] misleading to you but it is meant as more of a visual effect more than an accurate location of drivers in the area. It would be better of you to think of this as a screen saver on a computer. Once a rider request [s] a trip there will be actual information about the partners [sic] location showing up in the app.”

“In the mid-1980s, East German consumers continued to complain of both a shortage of workers in the service sector and deficient quality. Automobile repair facilities were inadequate, for example, as were supplies of spare parts … the number of supermarkets and other stores, restaurants, and service centers had risen significantly by the mid-1980s — it seemed clear that meeting the needs of an increasingly prosperous society would remain a problem in East Germany for the foreseeable future. In the 1980s, the government acknowledged the existence of the problem and encouraged specialized private craftsmen and traders to help fill the void.”

AUTO-FUCKING MATION
<br><br>
So the constant growth the West once relied upon to continually expand job opportunities is failing. On average, new businesses create 40% fewer jobs than they did 20 years ago. Even during recent periods of economic growth, levels of employment have not risen in real terms.<sup>1</sup><br> 
The reality is that the economy is reliant on an ever-shrinking workforce. And according to 37% of British adults, many of the jobs that remain feel meaningless and performative.<sup>2</sup>  The problem is that as a society we maintain a sense of self-worth based on and inextricable from our jobs, even if they are unnecessary and underpaid. And so we see automation not as an opportunity, but as an existential threat. The idea seems to be that if we lost our jobs, we would lose something integral to our humanity.<br> 
Obviously there are jobs we can agree should be done by humans, like nursing, and social care. But why shouldn’t we automate the menial work done in offices, warehouses, and factories? It may be difficult to conceive of, but the time freed from work could be used to nurture creative and social capacities that are for now often unavailable to those working these kinds of jobs.<sup>3,4</sup>  And beyond that, more free time for any activity would be good, right?<br>
Automation reduces required labour time and makes production more efficient. How about using the time saved to reduce the working week? How about spreading the remaining work across the population? Neither of these ideas is even new. Our working weeks have been reduced before. We owe the two-day weekend we’ve got now to the widespread absenteeism of workers on “Saint Mondays” in the 19th century.<sup>5</sup><br>   
The logistics of nationwide work-sharing are surmountable. Similar schemes were successfully implemented in Germany to maintain employment levels after the 2009 crash. And work reduction would benefit society.  When the competition for a petty wage is removed, the door is opened for tighter knit communities to form. More free time means less stress, and fewer burdens on the elderly and those struggling with mental health issues.<sup>6</sup>  Reducing work could help save the environment too. Like it’s estimated that a switch to a shorter European working week in the US would result in a 20% drop in energy consumption nationwide.<sup>7</sup>  Because work-related energy consumption doesn’t just come from production itself – travel, and the wasteful convenience goods demanded by busy lifestyles play a massive part too.<br>
Automation could reduce all of this while maintaining production output. And since it could in this way play a key part in abetting environmental catastrophe, it should be an urgent political demand. But until now automation has been surrendered to the ‘market’. And this has resulted and will likely continue to result in higher energy consumption, obviously to the detriment of the environment.<sup>8</sup>   And then not even 10% of the US companies that could implement automation have, despite its increasing accessibility.<sup>9</sup>   Confusing, right. Somehow wages are so stagnant that human labour is often still cheaper than automation.<sup>10</sup><br>  
This is where UBI comes in. In order for the prosperity that automation can create to be distributed equitably, we must argue for a liveable universal basic income. Not as a replacement for state services and welfare policies – that would be insensitive to the variety of needs within society – but as a supplement to them. Beyond the potential alleviation of poverty for all citizens, a liveable UBI would bend market forces to the advantage of regular people: really unpleasant jobs would have to be better paid, and that in itself would incentivize their automation.  It’d make “if you don’t like it – leave” a legitimate option for everyone, and would weaken the capacity for economic coercion that underlies abusive relationships both in and out of the workplace.<br> 
Funding for UBI remains a political obstacle rather than an economic one. In the UK the richest 10% of households hold 45% of the wealth, where the bottom 50% hold just 8.7%. A progressive tax used to fund UBI would not meaningfully impact the ability of the rich to live, to eat well, to clothe themselves, to be free from economic anxiety. But these apparent luxuries are denied to the 22% of the UK population who live in poverty,<sup>11</sup>  and who would benefit massively from the implementation of a UBI. Reallocating existing resources in this way would avoid the problem of inflation so often brought up in conversations about UBI.<br>
Many people across the ‘political spectrum’ seem to agree that increased automation and the implementation of UBI are inevitable. But there’s still lots of disagreement as to what forms they will take. The proposals outlined here may seem ambitious. But there’s a lot at stake, and without a collective effort to prioritise ecology and societal cohesion, the power of automation will be wasted in pollution and profit. So.<br><br>
Demand automation.<br><br>
Demand a liveable, universal, basic income.<br><br>
Demand free time.
