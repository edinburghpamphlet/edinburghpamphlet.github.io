<h1>Edinburgh Pamphlet</h1>
<p class="small"> <div class="a"> In recent years the way we think about the future has been completely hijacked by dystopian fantasies. They’re everywhere: on TV and in films, in books and the news media. They are often presented as Intelligent Critiques of The System. But their content betrays a bleak impotence when it comes to conceptualising of a future that does not involve either catastrophe or systematized absurdity. What we lack and what we need are well-articulated alternatives for the future. Visions that are at once reasonable, optimistic, and accessible to all. Let’s have a go.

THING ABOUT MAKING THINGS AND GETTING THINGS TO EVERYBODY WHO NEEDS THE THINGS
<br>
<br>
So, Technology. It’s everywhere you bloody look. Over here. Over there. Yesterday, when I opened my front door. Technology was standing right there, naked, reading a biology textbook. I mean, fucking hell, something out of a film.
Seriously though. Sometimes seems technology is progressing at an absurd rate. Like watch the Google keynote for [current year] – insane. And sorry for being obvious, but it is mad that lots what of what we do each day in [also current year] is facilitated by complex computer programs. 
When we use them they’re impressively simple. Example: on your phone, they recommend you a book/film/garment/etc. you’ll probably like. So you buy it. And if you’re lucky (or have Amazon Prime) it’ll be in your hands within 24 hours. Wham. Bam. 
The way computer-aided processes like this actually work can seem pretty abstract and inexplicable, sort of dislocated from the Real World where people eat Haribo Starmix and do shits in the toilet. But I guess we can nail it down to a couplthings. 1st, instantaneous wireless communication. 2nd, programs designed to improve their own efficiency and productivity based on the data they gather.
So they recommend you the thing based on data about what you (and people like you) have ordered/looked at in the past. You buy it, and Amazon wirelessly requests money from your bank. The bank accepts, money gets transferred from your account to Amazon, and some of that money gets transferred to the item’s seller. A request is sent to a regional distributor; your local warehouse may already have the item stocked based on their prediction you’d buy it.<sup>1</sup>  The driver takes your package along a precisely optimized delivery route that distributes stops over a set time period, accounting for traffic and other factors.<sup>2</sup>   Thank you ma’am.
This sort of technology is how Uber can get me from where I am to where I wanna be within 15m. How Google/Siri/Amazon Echo can give you what you’re searching for. And also how I can have sexual relations with a person on a remote Pacific Island in real-time using a remote-control knob/punanni/other and a cheap webcam – not saying I do.
All impressive. Not all good. Take Uber. Who like I said also use data they’ve gathered to ‘refine their service’. They know a rider is more likely to order an expensive Uber if their phone battery is low – so they hike the prices if it is. And that they’re more likely to order if they can see cars nearby on the map – so they show fake ones if there aren’t real ones around.<sup>3</sup>   I’m not making this up. But that’s it – this technology is amazing and useful, but is only really being used to make profit for shareholders.
Meanwhile things are shit, let’s agree. People dying. People suffering. Shitty jobs. Shitty pay. High rent. Polluted air/water/food that’s only getting worse. And more. How many basic requirements for a decent life aren’t being met properly because doing so wouldn’t be profitable? 
Obviously this question’s been asked before. In the past century many countries experimented with economic alternatives meant (they said) to fix these problems.  Thing is they failed, more or less. Why? I’m not sure exactly. But one reason lots of people give is inefficiency. Though quality of life was generally really good,<sup>4</sup>   ‘Central Planning’ in places like ‘socialist’ East Germany did lead to absurdity, especially when it came to ‘consumer’ goods – toilet paper, tampons, tissues, tents, Twix. It was hard for planners to keep track of the vast networks of local supply and local demand for such things. Like what kind of chocolate people in the north-western bit of the south-eastern bit of the seventh-largest city in the country preferred, and whether they had the incorrect opinion, i.e. that Twix isn’t by far the best. A shop might have loadsa beer, but no tissues. Or, god-forbid, the other way round. It was so bad the government ended up encouraging small private enterprises – a big no-no given the whole ‘socialist’ thing – in order to help solve the problem.<sup>5</sup>    
Thing is they were basically doing it all on paper. They didn’t have computers or any of the shit Uber’s got to efficiently track and respond to countless variables in real-time. And now I think you might see what I’m getting at – what if they did.
Well, when President Salvador Allende of Chile started nationalizing foreign-owned industry in 1970 in order to fund public projects, he encountered similar problems.<sup>6</sup>   But interestingly he actually tried using new tech to fix them. A system called Cybersyn linked all the firms in the country (Chile, in 1970!) and allowed them to send info both to each other and to the government. A program monitored national input/output statistics based on the communications. It could intelligently recognize anomalies, and, if appropriate, send alerts so people could quickly respond to them. Firms could detect problems in their operation and fix them. Sectors of industry could efficiently coordinate to fix larger problems, and also just to be more productive.<sup>7</sup>   Data gathered over a long period was used to predict future data. Sounds pretty similar to a lot of the systems companies use today, right? Unfortunately a coup overthrew Allende in 1973 and Cybersyn was dismantled. It hadn’t worked perfectly. Didn’t gather enough variables, for one. And this was the 1970s. The network was based on electromechanical typewriters that could only relay data once a day, for fuck’s sake.
What I’m thinking is what if we tried again. What if we used the immense coordinating power technology has provided us to facilitate a more just society? Ambulances that know where they need to be before an accident happens – shit like that. Basic things like clean water distributed for free to everyone who needs them, precisely and efficiently –  shit like that. Just a thought.

This article (amongst other damning info) contains a quotation from a representative of Uber:
<br>
<br>        
“The app is simply showing there are partners time. This is not a representation of the exact number of drivers or their location. This is more of a visual effect letting people know that partners are searching for fares. I know this seems a [sic] misleading to you but it is meant as more of a visual effect more than an accurate location of drivers in the area. It would be better of you to think of this as a screen saver on a computer. Once a rider request [s] a trip there will be actual information about the partners [sic] location showing up in the app.”

By this study’s measure of ‘physical quality of life’, socialist countries outperformed capitalist countries on average.

“In the mid-1980s, East German consumers continued to complain of both a shortage of workers in the service sector and deficient quality. Automobile repair facilities were inadequate, for example, as were supplies of spare parts … the number of supermarkets and other stores, restaurants, and service centers had risen significantly by the mid-1980s — it seemed clear that meeting the needs of an increasingly prosperous society would remain a problem in East Germany for the foreseeable future. In the 1980s, the government acknowledged the existence of the problem and encouraged specialized private craftsmen and traders to help fill the void.”
