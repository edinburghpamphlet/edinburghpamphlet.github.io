So, Technology. Technology, like. Well, you know, Technology. It’s everywhere you bloody look, mate. Get out of yer bed, look at yer phone. That’s Technology. Get in yer car. Turn on the engine. Yep. That’s also Technology. I mean, think about it. Yesterday I opened my front door and Technology was standing right there, naked, reading a biology textbook. I mean, fucking hell, something out of a film.
Seriously though. Sometimes seems like technology is accelerating at an absurd rate. Like check out the Google keynote for [current year] – bit insane. And sorry for being obvious, but it is mad that a lot of what we do on the day to day in [current year also] is mediated by complex computer programs. 
When we use them they’re simple. They’re on your phone, recommending you a book you’ll probably buy. In a warehouse, telling a worker how many books they need to package in the next hour. In the company headquarters, generating a nice graph showing the CEO how much money he has made, is making, and is going to make.
