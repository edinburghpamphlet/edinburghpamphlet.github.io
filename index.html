  Thing about making things and getting things to everyone who needs the things
<br>
So, Technology. Technology, like. Well, you know, Technology. It’s everywhere you bloody look, mate. Get out of yer bed, look at yer phone. That’s Technology. Get in yer car. Turn on the engine. Yep. That’s also Technology. I mean, think about it. Yesterday I opened my front door and Technology was standing right there, naked, reading a biology textbook. I mean, fucking hell, something out of a film.
Seriously though. Sometimes seems like technology is accelerating at an absurd rate. Like check out the Google keynote for [current year] – bit insane. And sorry for being obvious, but it is mad that a lot of what we do on the day to day in [current year also] is mediated by complex computer programs. 
When we use them they’re simple. They’re on your phone, recommending you a book you’ll probably buy. In a warehouse, telling a worker how many books they need to package in the next hour. In the company headquarters, generating a nice graph showing the CEO how much money he has made, is making, and is going to make.
Thing is the way they all actually work can seem pretty abstract and inexplicable, sort of dislocated from the Real World where people eat Haribo Starmix and do shits in the toilet. But I guess we can nail it down to a couple of things. First, instantaneous wireless communication. Second, programs designed to autonomously improve their own functioning based on the data they interact with. 
All the books you’ve ever bought, what they know about other people who buy similar books your age, and lots of other data becomes that book you’re definitely gonna like. Demand, supply, a calculation of a workers potential – based on previous performance averages and increased slightly to increase productivity – and lots of other data becomes how many books that worker has to package. Real-time calculations of books sold, books bought, prices of books, strength of the economy, and, you guessed it, lots of other data becomes that live visual graph the CEO’s wanking over. And all these calculations are going on far away in massive, low-lying buildings in some American desert with rooms full of big black rectangles that smell of plasticky metal.
It’s how I can get Amazon to bring something to my door in 4 hours. How I can get an Uber to come and take me home all in the space of 15 minutes. How I can have sexual relations with a person located on the remote Pacific Island of Tonga in real-time using a remote-control knob/punanni/other and a cheap webcam. Not saying I do.
All impressive. Not all good. Take Uber. Like Amazon they use ‘big data’ to make their service more efficient. Based on past trends, they know more or less how many taxis need to be in Cowgate at 3am on a Saturday – a fuck-ton – so they get drivers to be there at that time. Useful. Better for riders. Sure. But they know other things too. Like how a rider’s more likely to order a more expensive Uber if the battery on their phone is low – guess what they do with that info. Or how someone’s more likely to order an Uber if they can see loads of cars nearby on the map – and therefore just show fake ones if there aren’t many real ones around.  Not making this up. I guess it’s obvious: this technology is used by Uber to make Uber work better for Uber. 
And despite how mad this technology is, and how much it can/does do for everyone, things are still shit. People dying. People suffering. Shitty jobs. Shitty pay. High rent. Polluted air/water/food that’s only gonna get worse. And more. How many basic requirements for a decent life aren’t being met properly? Could we do something to meet those requirements?
Obviously these questions have been asked before. I mean in the past century a fair few countries experimented with economic alternatives meant (they said) to fix these problems.  Thing is they failed, more or less. Why? Well I’m not sure exactly. But one reason lots of people say is inefficiency. Even though quality of life was generally really good,  ‘Central planning’ in places like ‘socialist’ East Germany led to absurdity, especially when it came to ‘consumer’ goods – toilet paper, tampons, tissues, tents, Twix. It was hard for planners to keep track of the vast network of local supply and local demand for these things. Like what kind of chocolate bar inhabitants in the north-western bit of the south-eastern bit of the seventh-largest city in the country preferred, and whether they had the incorrect opinion, i.e. that Twix isn’t by far the best. A shop might have loadsa beer, but no tissues. Or god-forbid the other way round. It was so bad the government ended up encouraging small private enterprises – a big no-no given the ‘socialist’ thing – in order to help solve the problem.   
Thing is they were doing this all on paper. They didn’t got no computers or nothing, none of the shit Uber’s got, no means to efficiently track and respond to thousands of variables in real time. And the Berlin wall fell in 1989.
I think you might see what I’m getting at.  What if they did.
Well, when President Salvador Allende of Chile started nationalizing foreign-owned industry in 1970 in order to fund public investment, he encountered the same management problem.  But he actually tried to use new technology to fix it. A system called Cybersyn connected all the factories and firms in the country (Chile, in 1970!) and allowed them to send info both to each other and to the government. Part of it monitored inputs and outputs nationally and would intelligently recognize anomalies, and, if appropriate, send alerts so people could quickly respond to them. Firms were able to detect problems in their operation and fix them. Sectors of industry could efficiently coordinate both to fix larger problems, and also just to be more productive.  The data gathered over long periods of time could be used to predict future data. Sounds a lot like Uber, right? Well, kinda was. Unfortunately a coup overthrew Allende’s government and Cybersyn was destroyed. It hadn’t worked perfectly. It didn’t gather enough variables really, and also, this was the 1970s. The network was based on electromechanical typewriters that could only relay data once a day, for fuck’s sake.
What I’m thinking is what if we tried again. What if we used the immense coordinating power that technology imbues on us to facilitate a more just society? Ambulances that know where they need to be before an accident happens, shit like that. Basic needs like clean water distributed to everyone in the world that needs it precisely and efficiently. Shit like that. Just a thought.
